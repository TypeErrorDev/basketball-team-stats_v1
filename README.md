## Overview

### The challenge

I was given a list of teams and players and been tasked with cleaning up the player data and then organizing the players into equal teams for an upcoming basketball season.

I'll apply my knowledge of built-in Python data types and combine these types to create structures to store and organize a team of Basketball players into distributed teams. This tool will not only balance the teams by the total number of players but also let you generate some statistics for a given team.

## My process

### Built with

- Python 3.9

### What I learned

I learned how to use Python to read and write files, get data from a user, and store data in a dictionary. I also learned how to use Python to create a command-line tool that runs in the terminal.
